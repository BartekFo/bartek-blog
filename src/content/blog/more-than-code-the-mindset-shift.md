title: "More Than Code: The Mindset Shift"
excerpt: 'I used to believe my worth was tied to writing perfect code. Experience taught me the real challenges are human, not technical. Now, with AI as my "Iron Man suit," my focus has shifted from technical purity to creating real value for users.'

For a long time, I believed my worth as a developer was measured by the quality of my code. When I started my journey in IT, I felt like I was already way behind. My interest in programming only sparked in tech school during a web development class, and I had this image in my head that the "real" programmers were the ones who’d been sitting in a basement with a hoodie on since they were 10, writing C compilers for fun. That made me feel like my whole career would just be about playing catch-up, learning different paradigms and libraries.

As I gained experience, however, I started to notice something. The biggest problems our teams faced never came from technical mistakes, like misusing a React hook or not abstracting a function. **The real challenges were about how we communicate.** In one project I worked on, a developer was tasked with reworking the app's data management logic to better match what the client had, making it easier for users to share data. On paper, the task was done quickly and without major issues. But soon after, new problems kept popping up during testing by our QA team or the client. Tickets would come back, new edge cases were found, and we were all wondering what was going on.

It turned out the root cause wasn't our technical skill or how we built the architecture, but how well we understood the business and focused on the product's actual needs. If I only see myself as the "guy who writes code" and can't look beyond the rigid points in a user story to start a discussion and pull out all the necessary information, and then truly own the feature from start to finish, there will always be more problems. I would just jump from one task to the next without ever seeing the bigger picture.

I quickly learned that the easiest engineers to work with were the ones who had this mindset. They deeply understood what was most important to the user and the business. They knew which tasks had the highest priority, where it was okay to build something simple for now, and which problems deserved more time and detailed analysis. These are also the people who aren't afraid to say, "I don't know," and are always willing to talk through a problem.

This pragmatism is crucial because we constantly work with deadlines. Business realities often require us to validate ideas quickly. In these moments, the goal is to deliver a solution that helps our users right away, without being a technical disaster that’s impossible to maintain. It's a balance. And the engineers who understand this balance are the ones who move projects forward.

This focus on value over pure technical perfection is reflected everywhere in the industry. We've all seen beautifully engineered products from startups fail, while companies with messy, 10-year-old PHP scripts are making millions. This taught me the most crucial lesson of my career: as engineers, **we aren't hired to write perfect code, but to solve real problems for our users.**

When you see your role as a "technical problem-solver" for the product, you become less attached to the code itself. It still stings to delete a feature you poured your heart into. No one likes throwing away work. But now, I see it differently. **It's not a failure; it's a course correction.** We just learned what the user _doesn't_ want, and that's valuable information.

Lately, I spend very little time fixing trivial bugs in my code or errors my IDE throws. These are often things I've done many times in other projects, and they just burned up my time. Now, I jump into a task and use an agent to create a skeleton for the implementation, analyze dependencies, and build a ready solution based on that. I don't generate the entire solution from start to finish with AI, but I use it to speed up my work so I don't have to wonder how to start something. It's much easier to refactor a proof-of-concept than to write it from scratch. This also lets me focus on the bigger picture of how everything will work and connect with the rest of the app. If I don't know something or need to look it up, instead of burning fifteen minutes searching a repo, I ask the agent and move on.

I love the comparison of AI to the **Iron Man suit**. Often, the hype we see on X or Reddit points toward a self-sufficient technology that can do everything from A to Z. I see a suit that helps and gives us abilities we didn't have before, but it still needs a human inside. Besides, I love writing code too much to give it up completely. But at the same time, I love creating valuable products and solving user problems just as much, and that's why I'm glad this kind of value is becoming even more important. Our value becomes connecting the product world with complex technical solutions.
