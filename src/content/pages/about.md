## Web developer from Poland

**Greetings!** I'm Bartosz Fórmanowski, a passionate web developer.

Everyone has a story. Mine doesn't start with a flash of genius, but with a quiet voice of doubt in a school hallway. At 17, taking my first steps into programming, I felt like I was late to a party that was already in full swing.

However, that uncertainty turned out to be my greatest strength. Instead of blindly chasing technical perfection, I had to learn something more important: technology is made by people, for people. My career took off when I understood that the most important thing isn't the lines of code, but the conversations that lead to them.

I realized that my experience—balancing the world of code with the world of human relationships—is a unique asset. And that's what I want to share here.

This blog is the result of my journey. Here, you'll find my thoughts on teamwork, how to approach new technologies, and building a career in IT on your own terms. It's a space for everyone who believes that behind every great project is not just great code, but above all, great collaboration.
